<b>Libraries</b>

<p>Python libraries are <b>set of useful functions<b>. Therefore we dont have to write code from scratch. When we input a library to a program we get access to more features without writing additional code. In this game <b>random library</b>is imported. Libraries are usually added on top of the code. We can use random library get our program to do something randomly.</p>
